# Indoor-Positioning-System-iMSEL
please let me know if you need any other materials since I may forget to upload something.
1. the first step is to get camera matrix and distortion coefficients. For more details, please refer to this website: https://learnopencv.com/camera-calibration-using-opencv/
2. the second step is to train data-driven model
3. it is to implement the code in your laptop

please cite this paper if you use the code or data:
